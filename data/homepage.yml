      description: "Publication on ACM and IEEE, presenting research on image simplification using Machine Learning algorithms and compression techniques (DCT, neural imaging, PIL, shrinking) at the 2023 ANNSIM Conference. We conducted simulations (SIR, Cascade, Rumor) to generate images based on adjacency matrices, applying reordering methods to highlight pattern emergence (found crucial in maintaining performance levels despite image compression). We then evaluated images using DT, RF, and SVMs to assess the effectiveness of the applied techniques and algorithms. BEA reordering algorithm outperformed with accuracy (99.91%), precision (99.82%), recall (100%), and F-1 score (99.91%)."
