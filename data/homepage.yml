In this group project, we studied simplifying images onto the ability of a ML algorithm to pick up patterns. We compressed 10,000 images, performed simulations (SIR, Cascade, and Rumor models) to produce images  based on adjacency matrix; outputs used reordering methods to highlight the correct emergence of patterns, and evaluated images after hyperparameter tuning."
