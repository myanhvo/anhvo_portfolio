  subtitle: "Data Analyst"
  description: " <br> I'm passionate about using data to drive impact. After earning my degree in Data Science and Statistics from Miami University, I’ve gained hands-on experience across research, industry, and higher ed — from supporting research studies to analyzing clinical trials data. Now, as a Data Analyst at the University of Toledo, I build and maintain Power BI reports and modernize legacy systems using Oracle SQL. Whether it’s education, healthcare, or beyond, I’m always excited to explore new challenges where data can make a difference.
